### 1. Data
Download the dataset from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TZhp3jteK5Uash7cc_HW14XmeWPYYw3J/view?usp=sharing. Unzip the file and put the folder at root directory (same directory as "code" folder).

### 2. Setup
- Model training: run notebook model_training.ipynb
- Network visualization: run notebook visualization.ipynb
- Prediction evaluation: run notebook prediction_evaluation.ipynb
- Note1: we run our code on Google Colab. If you need to run on your local machine, some of the given paths in the notebook should be edited.
- Note2: we saved our trained model in "model_save" folder. We load the trained model in network visualization and prediction evaluation.
